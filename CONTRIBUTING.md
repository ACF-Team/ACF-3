# Contributing to ACF

## Did you find a bug?

- You can save some time by making sure the bug wasn't already reported by someone else by checking the [existing issues](https://github.com/ACF-Team/ACF-3/labels/bug) before creating a new issue.

- If the bug you intend to report is a potential vulnerability, as explained in the [security policy](SECURITY.md), then follow the procedures listed in the previous article rather than creating an issue.

- If the bug hasn't been previously reported and is not a vulnerability then please [create a new issue](https://github.com/ACF-Team/ACF-3/issues/new/choose) using the "bug report" template provided.

- When filling out the template make sure to fill in all non optional fields, otherwise we will need to contact you for a follow up to gather the missing information.

## Do you have a suggestion?

- Rather than making a new suggestion for something already suggested, rally behind it in the [existing suggestions](https://github.com/ACF-Team/ACF-3/labels/enhancement) page rather than splitting up the threads.

- If no one's suggested what you want to bring up before then you're welcome to [start a new thread](https://github.com/ACF-Team/ACF-3/issues/new/choose) for it using the "suggestion report" template provided.

- Please give your suggestion a title and clear description of what you'd like added so that we can understand you better. If you'd like to further clarify, you are free to leave some references.

- Suggestions missing titles and/or descriptions will be closed if the missing information is not rectified.

## Do you plan to merge something?

- Make sure nobody created a pull request with something similar to what you're planning to merge. Check the [existing pull requests](https://github.com/ACF-Team/ACF-3/pulls) before creating a new one.

- Support is always appreciated. If you fixed or added something you're free to start a [new pull request](https://github.com/ACF-Team/ACF-3/compare).

- All pull requests that added and/or modified something inside the lua folder will be linted. You'll have to rectify your code in case it doesn't pass the test.

- All pull requests will be reviewed by the developer team before being accepted and later merged into the addon. Try to cooperate whenever it's required.

## Do you have any questions?

- You can just [join our official Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/jgdzysxjST) and contact the developers. Please consider that the response may not be immediate.

Our idea is to take full advantage of what ACF can be, only you can help to achieve this.
