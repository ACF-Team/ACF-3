acf.storyboards.turrets.turret_basics.chapter2.explain_hmotor=This is a hydraulic motor. These are strong motors, but take a little bit to get up to speed.
acf.storyboards.turrets.turret_basics.chapter2.explain_emotor=This is an electric motor. These aren't as strong, but can get to speed pretty fast.
acf.storyboards.turrets.turret_basics.chapter2.explain_motordiff=These motors can be used interchangeably, just use whatever suits your needs.
acf.storyboards.turrets.turret_basics.chapter2.explain_motorreq=A turret can work without a motor, as it has a handcrank that it can fall back on. It isn't fast, nor is it strong, however.
acf.storyboards.turrets.turret_basics.chapter3=Gyroscopes
acf.storyboards.turrets.turret_basics.chapter3.explain_gyro=This is a gyroscope. These require a motor to function, but when working, will stabilize up to 100% of the turret's capable speed.
